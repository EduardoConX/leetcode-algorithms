# Challenge #10 - Container With Most Water

## Problem Summary

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`.  
There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `i`-th line are at `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find **two lines** that together with the x-axis form a container that holds the **most water**.

Return *the maximum amount of water* a container can store.

---

## Example

**Input:**

```javascript
height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
```


**Output:**

```javascript
49
```


**Explanation:**  
The container formed between lines at index `1` and `8` can hold up to `49` units of water (`min(8, 7) * (8 - 1)`).

## Approach

This problem can be solved efficiently using the **two-pointer technique**.

### Key Idea

- Start with one pointer at the beginning (`left`) and one at the end (`right`).  
- Calculate the area formed between the two lines.  
- Move the pointer pointing to the **shorter** line inward since that’s the limiting factor for the area.  
- Continue until both pointers meet.

This yields an **O(n)** solution — much faster than checking all pairs (O(n²)).

## Algorithm (Pseudocode)

```text
set left = 0
set right = n - 1
set maxArea = 0

while left < right:
    heightLeft = height[left]
    heightRight = height[right]
    width = right - left
    currentArea = min(heightLeft, heightRight) * width
    maxArea = max(maxArea, currentArea)

    if heightLeft < heightRight:
        left = left + 1
    else:
        right = right - 1

return maxArea
```

---

## JavaScript Implementation

```javascript
function maxArea(height) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = height.length - 1;
  let maxArea = 0;

  while (left < right) {
    const width = right - left;
    const currentArea = Math.min(height[left], height[right]) * width;
    maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, currentArea);

    if (height[left] < height[right]) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }

  return maxArea;
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` — we traverse the array once.  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` — we only use constant extra space.
