# Problem #1 - Two Sum  

## Problem Summary
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the **two numbers** such that they add up to `target`.  
Each input will have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.  

---

## Approach 1: Brute Force  

### Algorithm  
1. Loop over all pairs of numbers `(i, j)` in the array.  
2. For each pair, check if `nums[i] + nums[j] == target`.  
3. If yes, return `[i, j]`.  

### Pseudocode  
```text
function twoSum(nums, target):
    for i from 0 to length(nums) - 1:
        for j from i + 1 to length(nums) - 1:
            if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                return [i, j]
```

- Time Complexity: O(n^2)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

## Approach 2: Hash Map (Optimized)

### Algorithm

1. Initialize an empty hash map (dictionary).
2. Iterate through the array:
3. For each element nums[i], calculate complement = target - nums[i].
4. If complement is already in the hash map, return [hashMap[complement], i].
5. Otherwise, store nums[i] in the hash map with its index.

### Pseudocode
```text
function twoSum(nums, target):
    hashMap = empty map
    for i from 0 to length(nums) - 1:
        complement = target - nums[i]
        if complement in hashMap:
            return [hashMap[complement], i]
        hashMap[nums[i]] = i
```

- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(n)
