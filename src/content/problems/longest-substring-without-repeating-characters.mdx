# Problem #3 - Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters  

## Problem Summary  
Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.  

Example:  
```text
Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: "abc" is the longest substring without repeating characters.
```

## Approach 1: Brute Force  

### Algorithm  
1. Generate all possible substrings.  
2. For each substring, check if all characters are unique.  
3. Track the maximum length of valid substrings.  

### Pseudocode  
```text
function lengthOfLongestSubstring(s):
    maxLength = 0
    for i from 0 to length(s) - 1:
        for j from i to length(s) - 1:
            substring = s[i..j]
            if substring has all unique characters:
                maxLength = max(maxLength, length(substring))
    return maxLength
```

- Time Complexity: O(n^3)
- Space Complexity: O(min(m, n)), where m is the size of the character set.

## Approach 2: Sliding Window with Hash Set (Optimized)

### Algorithm

1. Use two pointers (left, right) to represent a sliding window.
2. Maintain a hash set of characters inside the window.
3. Move right forward:
4. If s[right] is not in the set, add it and update maxLength.
5. If s[right] is already in the set, remove characters from the left until the duplicate is gone.
6. Continue until right reaches the end.

### Pseudocode

```text
function lengthOfLongestSubstring(s):
    set = empty hash set
    left = 0
    maxLength = 0

    for right from 0 to length(s) - 1:
        while s[right] in set:
            remove s[left] from set
            left += 1
        add s[right] to set
        maxLength = max(maxLength, right - left + 1)

    return maxLength
```

- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(min(m, n)), where m is the size of the character set.

## Key Insight

The brute force approach is too slow. The sliding window technique optimizes by expanding the substring with the right pointer and shrinking it with the left pointer only when necessary. This ensures linear time performance.
