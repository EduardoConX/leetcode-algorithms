      Problem-solving is the heart of programming. The ability to analyze a
      problem, recognize the right approach, and implement an efficient solution
      is what separates good engineers from great ones.

    <p class="text-xl">
      This collection is my personal journey through LeetCode problems, written
      not just to keep track of solutions, but to build a playbook of algorithms
      and techniques. Each problem is more than a coding exercise, it is a
      lesson in problem decomposition, algorithm design, and optimization.
